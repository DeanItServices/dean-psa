# Authority Enforcer

Validates and enforces agent authority boundaries during wave execution and review panels. Prevents agent conflicts by ensuring domain ownership is respected.

---

## Section 1: Authority Loading

Load and parse the authority matrix to establish domain ownership rules.

### Step 1: Load Authority Matrix

```yaml
Input: None (uses hardcoded path)
Output: AuthorityMatrix object

Procedure:
1. Read `.planning/config/authority-matrix.yaml`
2. Parse YAML into structured object
3. Store in memory: agent_id → AgentConfig mapping
4. Build reverse index: domain → primary_agent_id
```

### Step 2: Validate Matrix Integrity

```yaml
Input: AuthorityMatrix
Output: ValidationReport

Checks:
1. All agent IDs exist in agent-registry
2. No domain is assigned to more than one agent as "exclusive"
3. Flag overlapping domains for conflict resolution
4. Verify deferred_by arrays are valid
```

**Validation Algorithm:**
```python
def validate_matrix(matrix):
    errors = []
    domain_owners = {}
    
    for agent_id, config in matrix.agents.items():
        # Check 1: Agent exists in registry
        if not registry.has_agent(agent_id):
            errors.append(f"Unknown agent: {agent_id}")
        
        # Check 2: No duplicate exclusive domains
        for domain in config.exclusive_domains:
            if domain in domain_owners:
                errors.append(
                    f"Domain conflict: '{domain}' assigned to both "
                    f"{domain_owners[domain]} and {agent_id}"
                )
            else:
                domain_owners[domain] = agent_id
    
    return ValidationReport(valid=len(errors) == 0, errors=errors)
```

---

## Section 2: Boundary Validation

Check if an agent is authorized to critique or act on a specific topic.

### Function: `validateBoundary`

```yaml
Input:
  agent_id: string          # Agent requesting action
  topic: string             # Topic/domain being addressed
  active_agents: string[]   # List of currently active agents

Output:
  authorized: boolean       # Whether agent can proceed
  domain_owner: string|null # Owner of this domain (if any)
  reason: string            # Explanation of decision
```

### Algorithm

```python
def validate_boundary(agent_id, topic, active_agents):
    # Mode check: skip validation if authority enforcement is disabled
    if not profile.authority_enforcement:
        return {
            authorized: True,
            domain_owner: None,
            reason: "Authority enforcement disabled by control mode"
        }

    # Load agent's exclusive domains from matrix
    agent_domains = matrix.get_domains(agent_id)

    # Check 1: Agent owns this topic
    if topic in agent_domains:
        return {
            authorized: True,
            domain_owner: agent_id,
            reason: "Agent has exclusive authority over this domain"
        }
    
    # Check 2: Another agent owns this topic
    for active_agent in active_agents:
        if active_agent == agent_id:
            continue
        
        active_domains = matrix.get_domains(active_agent)
        if topic in active_domains:
            return {
                authorized: False,
                domain_owner: active_agent,
                reason: f"{active_agent} has exclusive authority; respect domain owner"
            }
    
    # Check 3: No owner for this topic
    return {
        authorized: True,
        domain_owner: None,
        reason: "Topic has no exclusive owner; general domain"
    }
```

### Topic Matching

Topics are matched using keyword normalization:

```yaml
Normalization Rules:
  - Case-insensitive matching
  - Hyphens and underscores equivalent ("ci-cd" == "ci_cd")
  - Substring matching for compound topics:
      "api-security" matches both "api" and "security"
  
Specificity Scoring:
  - Exact match: score 10
  - Substring match: score 5
  - Related domain: score 2
  - No match: score 0
```

---

## Section 3: Prompt Injection

Inject authority constraints into agent prompts to prevent conflicts proactively.

### Function: `injectAuthorityConstraints`

```yaml
Input:
  agent_id: string
  base_prompt: string
  active_agents: string[]

Output:
  enhanced_prompt: string
```

### Algorithm

```python
def inject_authority_constraints(agent_id, base_prompt, active_agents):
    constraints = []
    
    # Step 1: Add agent's own authority
    own_domains = matrix.get_domains(agent_id)
    if own_domains:
        constraints.append(
            f"## Your Authority\\n\\n"
            f"You have EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY over these domains:\\n"
            + "\\n".join(f"- {d}" for d in own_domains)
            + "\\n\\nWhen active, other agents must respect your judgment in these areas."
        )
    
    # Step 2: Add deference rules for other active agents
    for other_agent in active_agents:
        if other_agent == agent_id:
            continue

        other_domains = matrix.get_domains(other_agent)
        if other_domains:
            agent_name = matrix.get_name(other_agent)
            constraints.append(
                f"\\n## Domain Ownership Required\\n\\n"
                f"{agent_name} ({other_agent}) has exclusive authority over:\\n"
                + "\\n".join(f"- {d}" for d in other_domains)
                + "\\n\\nDO NOT critique or override their findings in these domains."
            )

    # Step 3: Mode-specific constraints
    if profile.read_only:
        constraints.append(
            "\n## Advisory Mode Active\n\n"
            "You are in ADVISORY mode. Analyze and suggest improvements "
            "but DO NOT modify any files. Present your suggestions as a "
            "structured list of proposed changes with rationale."
        )

    if profile.file_scope_restriction:
        constraints.append(
            "\n## Surgical Mode — File Scope Restriction\n\n"
            "You may ONLY modify files explicitly listed in this plan's "
            "`files_modified` field. Do not create, edit, or delete any other files. "
            "If a task requires touching unlisted files, stop and escalate."
        )

    if not profile.human_approval_required:

        pass  # Do not append the standard "Human Approval Required" block
    else:

    else:

    return enhanced
```

### Example Output

```markdown
## Your Authority

You have EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY over these domains:
- security
- owasp
- vulnerability-assessment
- pentest

When active, other agents must respect your judgment in these areas.

## Domain Ownership Required

Backend Architect (engineering-backend-architect) has exclusive authority over:
- backend-architecture
- database-design
- api-design

DO NOT critique or override their findings in these domains.

```

**Note:** Constraint injection is the first line of defense. Post-execution boundary verification (Section 11) is the second line. Both are required for full authority enforcement.

---

## Section 4: Finding Filtering

Filter findings during review synthesis to remove out-of-domain critiques.

### Function: `filterFindings`

```yaml
Input:
  findings: Finding[]      # List of review findings
  active_agents: string[]  # Agents present in review panel

Output:
  filtered_findings: Finding[]
  removed_findings: Finding[]  # With reasons
```

### Finding Structure

```yaml
Finding:
  reviewer: string        # Agent ID who made the finding
  criterion: string       # What was checked
  severity: enum          # BLOCKER | WARNING | NOTE
  message: string         # Finding description
  domain: string          # Inferred domain (auto-detected)
```

### Algorithm

```python
def filter_findings(findings, active_agents):
    # Mode check: skip filtering if domain filtering is disabled
    if not profile.domain_filtering:
        return findings, []  # Return all findings, nothing removed

    filtered = []
    removed = []

    # Build domain ownership map from active agents
    domain_ownership = {}
    for agent in active_agents:
        for domain in matrix.get_domains(agent):
            domain_ownership[domain] = agent
    
    for finding in findings:
        # Step 1: Detect domain from criterion or message
        finding_domain = detect_domain(finding.criterion, finding.message)
        
        # Step 2: Check if domain has an owner in active agents
        if finding_domain in domain_ownership:
            owner = domain_ownership[finding_domain]
            
            # Step 3: Check if reviewer IS the owner
            if finding.reviewer == owner:
                filtered.append(finding)
            else:
                # Step 4: Check severity override rule
                if finding.severity == "BLOCKER":
                    # BLOCKER from any agent overrides domain ownership
                    filtered.append(finding)
                    finding.notes = (
                        f"[OVERRIDE] Out-of-domain BLOCKER kept per severity rule "
                        f"(domain owner: {owner})"
                    )
                else:
                    # Filter out non-BLOCKER findings from non-owners
                    removed.append({
                        **finding,
                        removal_reason: (
                            f"Out-of-domain critique filtered — "
                            f"{owner} is domain authority for '{finding_domain}'"
                        )
                    })
        else:
            # No owner for this domain, keep finding
            filtered.append(finding)
    
    return filtered, removed
```

### Domain Detection

`authority-enforcer` is the CANONICAL OWNER of domain detection. All consumers (review-panel, review-evaluators, wave-executor) MUST delegate to `detect_domain` here — they must NOT reimplement or fork keyword lists.

**Keyword source of truth:** `.planning/config/authority-matrix.yaml` under each domain's `keywords:` field. Do NOT hardcode keyword lists in this function — load from the matrix at runtime so one schema edit propagates to every consumer.

**Concrete conditions (explicit if/else — no "when appropriate"):**

1. IF `.planning/config/authority-matrix.yaml` exists AND parses AND contains a `domains:` map with `keywords:` entries:
   - Build `domain_keywords` = `{d.name: d.keywords for d in matrix.domains}`
2. ELSE (matrix missing or malformed):
   - Fall back to the BUILT-IN registry below — logged as a WARN so the missing matrix is visible, never silent.
3. Compute a keyword-hit score per domain against the lowercased `criterion + " " + message` text.
4. IF at least one domain scores > 0: return the highest-scoring domain (ties broken by domain order in the matrix — first declared wins).
5. ELSE: return `"general"` AND emit a DEBUG log `domain_detection: no keyword match for finding "{criterion_preview}"` so the "everything falls to general" failure mode from LEGION-47-174 is observable.

**Built-in fallback registry (used only when the matrix is unreadable).** This list MUST mirror every domain declared in `authority-matrix.yaml` — if the matrix adds a domain, add it here too in the same PR. No `# ... etc`:

```python
BUILT_IN_DOMAIN_KEYWORDS = {
    "security": [
        "security", "vulnerability", "pentest", "owasp", "auth",

def detect_domain(criterion, message, matrix=None, logger=None):

        return max(scores, key=lambda d: (scores[d], -ordered.index(d)))

    # Step 4: No match — observable "general" classification
    if logger:
        preview = (criterion or "")[:80]
        logger.debug(
            f"domain_detection: no keyword match for finding \"{preview}\"; "
            f"returning 'general'"
        )
    return "general"
```

**Consumer contract (binding):**
- `review-panel` MUST call `authority-enforcer.detect_domain(...)`. It MUST NOT define its own keyword list. Any private re-implementation is a P1 regression and must be deleted.
- `review-evaluators` MUST call `authority-enforcer.detect_domain(...)` before filtering findings.
- Schema coupling: when adding a new domain, update `authority-matrix.yaml` FIRST, then mirror the keyword list into `BUILT_IN_DOMAIN_KEYWORDS` above in the same commit. CI cross-reference check (see `scripts/audit/`) enforces parity.

## Section 5: Integration Points

### With Wave Executor

```yaml
Integration Point: Agent spawning
When: Before spawning agents for a wave
Action:
  1. Load authority matrix
  2. Build domain ownership map from selected agents
  3. For each agent:
     - Load personality file
     - Inject authority constraints via injectAuthorityConstraints()
     - Include escalation format instructions (from escalation-protocol.yaml)
     - Spawn with enhanced prompt
```

```yaml
Integration Point: Post-execution boundary verification
When: Immediately after agent completes a task (before escalation detection)
Action:
  1. Run Section 11 Post-Execution Boundary Check
  2. Record result (PASS/WARN/ENFORCED) in execution tracker
  3. If ENFORCED, revert out-of-scope files before proceeding
  4. If WARN, append violation details to SUMMARY.md
Reference: Section 11 of this skill
```

```yaml
Integration Point: Escalation detection
When: After agent completes a task (wave-executor Section 5.5)
Action:
  1. Wave-executor scans agent output for <escalation> blocks
  2. Also processes any escalation blocks generated by Section 11 boundary verification
  3. Validates escalation block format against escalation-protocol.yaml
  4. Routes by severity according to control mode behavior
  5. Records escalations in SUMMARY.md Escalations section
Reference: .planning/config/escalation-protocol.yaml
```

### With Review Panel

```yaml
Integration Point: Finding synthesis
When: After all reviewers submit findings
Action:
  1. Collect all findings from reviewers
  2. Get list of agents on review panel
  3. Call filterFindings() to remove out-of-domain critiques
  4. Log removed findings for transparency
  5. Synthesize remaining findings into final report
```

### With Agent Registry

```yaml
Integration Point: Team assembly
When: Building team for a task
Action:
  1. Query agent-registry for candidate agents
  2. Check for domain conflicts in proposed team
  3. Warn if multiple agents claim same exclusive domain
  4. Suggest resolution based on specificity hierarchy
```

---

## Section 6: Conflict Resolution

### Resolving Domain Conflicts

When two agents both claim authority over a topic:

```yaml
Resolution Steps:
  1. Check Specificity Hierarchy:
     - More specific domain beats general domain
     - Example: "laravel" beats "backend-architecture"
  
  2. Check Division Priority:
     - Testing-division overrides for verification topics
     - Engineering-division overrides for implementation topics
  
  3. Default to Explicit Assignment:
     - Use authority-matrix.yaml as source of truth
     - If still ambiguous, require human decision
```

### Logging and Transparency

```yaml
All authority decisions MUST be logged:
  - Timestamp
  - Active agents
  - Topic in question
  - Decision (authorized/domain-owned)
  - Domain owner (if applicable)
  - Reason

Log Location: `.planning/logs/authority-decisions-{date}.log`
```

---

## Section 7: Error Handling

### Common Errors

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Unknown agent in matrix | Agent ID typo or removed agent | Check agent-registry, update matrix |
| Duplicate domain assignment | Two agents claim same exclusive domain | Assign to more specific agent, mark other as secondary |
| Missing authority-matrix.yaml | File deleted or moved | Regenerate from template |
| Circular domain ownership | Agent A yields ownership to B while B yields ownership to A | Fix deferred_by arrays in matrix |

### Validation Command

```bash
# Validate authority matrix integrity
node bin/gsd-tools.cjs validate-authority-matrix

# Output: ValidationReport with errors/warnings
```

---

## Section 8: Usage Example

### Complete Workflow

```javascript
// 1. Load authority matrix
const matrix = loadAuthorityMatrix('.planning/config/authority-matrix.yaml');
const validation = validateMatrix(matrix);
if (!validation.valid) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid matrix: ${validation.errors.join(', ')}`);
}

// 2. Build active agents list

## Section 9: Maintenance

### When to Update This Skill

1. **New agent added**: Update matrix loading, add domain mappings
2. **Agent domains changed**: Update validation logic
3. **New conflict pattern identified**: Add resolution rule
4. **Integration point changed**: Update Section 5

### Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.0 | 2026-03-05 | Initial authority enforcer with boundary validation, prompt injection, and finding filtering |
| 1.1 | 2026-03-06 | Added Mode Profile Loading (Section 10) — control mode flag integration |
| 1.2 | 2026-03-31 | Added Post-Execution Boundary Verification (Section 11) — runtime enforcement after agent execution |

---

## Section 10: Mode Profile Loading

Receive the pre-resolved control mode profile from workflow-common-core's Settings Resolution Protocol. The profile is resolved ONCE at invocation start and passed to all authority-enforcer calls — the authority-enforcer does NOT read control-modes.yaml directly.

### Input

The resolved profile is a set of 5 boolean flags passed by the caller (wave-executor or review-panel):

| Flag | Type | Effect on Authority Enforcer |
|------|------|------------------------------|
| `authority_enforcement` | boolean | When false, skip Section 2 (Boundary Validation) entirely — all agents are authorized |
| `domain_filtering` | boolean | When false, skip Section 4 (Finding Filtering) — all findings are kept regardless of domain ownership |
| `human_approval_required` | boolean | When false, suppress escalation prompts in Section 3 (Prompt Injection) — agents do not remind about human approval |
| `file_scope_restriction` | boolean | When true, add file-scope constraint to Section 3 injected prompts — agents may ONLY modify files in plan `files_modified` |
| `read_only` | boolean | When true, add read-only constraint to Section 3 injected prompts — agents suggest but do not execute changes |

### Resolution Fallback

If no profile is provided (caller does not pass it), default to the `guarded` profile:
- `authority_enforcement: true`, `domain_filtering: true`, `human_approval_required: true`
- `file_scope_restriction: false`, `read_only: false`

This ensures backward compatibility — existing callers (including review-panel) that do not yet pass a profile get the same behavior as before.

### Flag Consumption Pattern

All earlier sections check flags before executing their logic:

Section 2 (Boundary Validation):
  if not profile.authority_enforcement: return { authorized: true, reason: "authority enforcement disabled by control mode" }

Section 3 (Prompt Injection):
  if profile.read_only: append "CONSTRAINT: You are in advisory mode. Suggest changes but do NOT modify any files."
  if profile.file_scope_restriction: append "CONSTRAINT: You may ONLY modify files listed in the plan's files_modified field."
  if not profile.human_approval_required: omit the escalation protocol reminder from injected constraints

Section 4 (Finding Filtering):
  if not profile.domain_filtering: return all findings unfiltered

Section 11 (Post-Execution Boundary Verification):
  if control_mode is "autonomous" or "advisory": skip verification entirely

---

## Section 11: Post-Execution Boundary Verification

Runtime enforcement that verifies agents stayed within their authorized scope after execution completes. Called by wave-executor after each agent finishes.

### When This Runs

This verification runs after every agent execution during `/legion:build`, regardless of control mode. The enforcement action differs by mode:

| Control Mode | Detection | Action on Violation |
|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| `autonomous` | Skip verification entirely | None |
| `guarded` | Detect out-of-scope file modifications | Warn in SUMMARY.md, add escalation block, continue |
| `advisory` | Not applicable (read-only agents) | None |
| `surgical` | Detect out-of-scope file modifications | Revert out-of-scope changes, log violation, continue with in-scope work only |

### Verification Procedure

```
Post-Execution Boundary Check:

Input:
  - agent_id: the agent that just completed
  - plan: the PLAN.md that was being executed
  - control_mode: from settings.json

Step 1: Skip check if not applicable
  - If control_mode is "autonomous" or "advisory": return PASS, skip all checks
  - If plan has no files_modified field: return PASS with warning "Plan lacks files_modified — cannot verify boundaries"

Step 2: Detect actual file modifications
  - Run: git diff --name-only HEAD (or compare against pre-execution snapshot)
  - Collect: list of files actually modified by this agent's execution

Step 3: Compare against authorized scope
  - authorized_files = plan.files_modified (from PLAN.md frontmatter)
  - actual_files = files detected in Step 2
  - out_of_scope = actual_files - authorized_files (set difference)
  - If out_of_scope is empty: return PASS

Step 4: Classify violations
  For each out-of-scope file:
    - severity = "high" if file is in plan.files_forbidden
    - severity = "high" if file is a config/infrastructure file (.env, CI/CD, package.json)
    - severity = "medium" if file is a source file outside the plan's scope
    - severity = "low" if file is a test file or documentation file

Step 5: Enforce based on control mode

  If control_mode is "guarded":
    a. Log violation to SUMMARY.md:
       ## ⚠️ Boundary Violation Detected
       Agent `{agent_id}` modified files outside authorized scope:
       | File | Severity | In files_forbidden? |
       |------|----------|-------------------|
       | {file} | {severity} | {yes/no} |

       Authorized scope: {files_modified list}

    b. Add escalation block:
       <escalation>
       severity: warning
       type: scope
       decision: Agent {agent_id} modified {count} files outside plan scope
       context: The following files were not in the plan's files_modified list: {file_list}. Review these changes and decide whether to keep or revert them.
       affected_files: {file_list}
       </escalation>

    c. Do NOT revert — changes are preserved for human review
    d. Return WARN

  If control_mode is "surgical":
    a. For each out-of-scope file:
       - Run: git checkout HEAD -- {file}  (revert to pre-execution state)
    b. Log reversion to SUMMARY.md:
       ## 🔒 Surgical Mode: Out-of-Scope Changes Reverted
       Agent `{agent_id}` attempted to modify files outside authorized scope.
       Reverted {count} files: {file_list}
       In-scope changes preserved: {authorized_files that were modified}
    c. Return ENFORCED

Step 6: Return result
  - PASS: no violations detected
  - WARN: violations detected, logged, preserved (guarded mode)
  - ENFORCED: violations detected, reverted (surgical mode)
```

### Integration with Wave Executor

The wave-executor calls this procedure at a specific point in its execution flow:

```
Wave Execution Flow (updated):
  1. Inject agent personality (existing)
  2. Inject authority constraints (existing Section 3)
  3. Execute agent task (existing)
  4. >>> NEW: Run Post-Execution Boundary Check <<<
  5. Record execution results (existing)
  6. Store outcome to memory (existing)
```

The boundary check result (PASS/WARN/ENFORCED) is included in the execution tracker's outcome record. WARN results increment the importance score by +1 (cross-scope work signal). ENFORCED results set outcome to "partial" (some work was discarded).

### Edge Cases

- **Agent creates new files not in files_modified**: Treated as out-of-scope. New files not in the authorized list are violations.
- **Agent modifies files that are in files_forbidden**: Always severity "high" regardless of control mode. In guarded mode, this escalation is severity "blocker" not "warning".
- **Git diff unavailable**: If git is not available or the diff command fails, log a warning and return PASS. Never block execution due to verification infrastructure failure.
- **Pre-execution snapshot unavailable**: If the wave-executor did not capture a pre-execution state, fall back to `git diff --name-only HEAD` which compares against the last commit. This may include changes from prior agents in the same wave — acceptable as a best-effort check.
